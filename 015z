                        Bootstrapping Acmeism

     * All tests written in TestML
     * TestML needs to be ported Everywhere
     * Everywhere == Ruby, Perl5, Python2, Node/Coffee
     * The TestML language is parsed by Pegex
       * The Pegex language is parsed by Pegex
       * and JSONY andâ€¦
     * Therefore Pegex needs to be ported Everywhere
     * Porting is very exact. Line for Line. Idiom for Idiom
     * So it can be generated by C'Dent
     * TestML and Pegex get ported to UniScript
     * And generated in 25 languages

         I need (lots of) HELP!
